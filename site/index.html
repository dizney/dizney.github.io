        <p>
          I am a software developer with more than 20 years of experience in developing (web)applications. My interests are broad, from devops to the user interface, but usually my focus is on backend development. Because of my broad knowledge I have a good technical overview of applications and get things working up to and including production environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a proponent for agile software development in which direct communication with the stakeholders is central and a product is built up in small steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly get up to speed with new technologies, and I am also a stable and reliable force and a binding factor in the teams I work in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked on clients like Rabobank, VanMoof, Just Eat Takeaway, Graydon, BVA Auctions, ING, Greenwheels, Belgacom, Essent, Backbase, De Lotto and Ben.
